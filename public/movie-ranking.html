<h1>The Best Movies According to James</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Casablanca (1942)</h3>
<p>I have loved this film ever since I first saw it as a teenager and it sparked my life long obsession with Humphrey Bogart. With its colourful cast of characters each scene is a stand out classic. </p>

<h3>The Big Lebowski (1998)</h3>
<p>More a comedy than a crime film with fun characters and zany situations it is no wonder this film has become a cult classic.</p>

<h3>The Matrix (1999)</h3>
<p>A fun action martial arts sci-fi with the opportunity for discussion about its deeper meaning if you feel like it. </p>
